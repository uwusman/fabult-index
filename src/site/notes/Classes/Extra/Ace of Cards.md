**Aces of Cards** make use of special **decks** to perceive the constant fluctuations of the stream of souls. Each deck is inextricably connected to its user and reflects their taste and personality: by drawing specific combinations at the right moment, an Ace of Cards manipulates magical energy to produce supernatural effects. In some worlds, Aces of Cards duel against each other using their personal decks, in a quest for glory or in order to obtain precious artifacts.

## Free Benefits
Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points or Mind Points by 5 (your choice).

## Skills
#### Double or Nothing
Before you perform an Accuracy Check, a Magic Check for an offensive spell (⚡︎), or a Check to advance or turn back a Clock, you may declare **double or nothing**. If you do and the Check triggers a **critical success**, **double** the damage dealt by that attack or spell or the filled or erased sections of that Clock, respectively; however, any other kind of success becomes a **failure** instead.
#### High or Low
When you generate a **critical success** or a **fumble**, you may draw 1 card from your **deck**. If you do, discard 1 card from your **hand**.
#### Magic Cards (✦3)
You gain a **deck**, a **hand** and a **discard pile** (see [[Class Info/Class Abilities/Ace of Cards - Decks\|Ace of Cards - Decks]]).

During a conflict, you may use an action and spend up to **【10 + (SL × 5)****】** Mind Points (minimum 10). If you do, **resolve 1 card** from your **hand** for every 5 MP spent this way (to a maximum of 5 cards; these cards form a **set**). After you resolve the effect of the **set** (if any), **discard** these cards and draw that many cards from your **deck**.
#### Mulligan (✦5)
At the end of your turn during a conflict, you may discard up to **【SL】** cards from your **hand**. If you do, draw that many cards from your **deck**.
#### Trap Card (✦4)
After an enemy you can see performs an action during a conflict, you may declare one of your **deck**'s **suits** (after the action has been resolved) and put the first card on the bottom of your **deck** in your **discard pile**, face up. If that card is a **joker** or its **suit** matches the one you declared, you may immediately perform the **Spell** action for free, casting a spell with a **total Mind Point cost equal to or lower than** **【SL × 5】** (you must still pay its MP cost).
