When you resolve the **Magic Pair** effect, if you attack with a weapon belonging to the **arcane** or **thrown** Category, you deal extra damage equal to **【the common value of the resolved cards】**  and regain an amount of Mind Points equal to **【twice the common value of the resolved cards】** (for instance, resolving a pair of **5s** will allow you to deal 5 extra damage and regain 10 Mind Points).
