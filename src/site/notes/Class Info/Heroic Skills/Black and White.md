> [!ERROR] Requirements
> You must have mastered one or more Classes among **Ace of Cards**, **Darkblade**, **Entropist**, and **Spiritist**, and you must have acquired the **Magic Cards** Skill.

When you resolve the **Double Trouble** effect, you may have all of its damage become **light** or **dark** (instead of being of a type matching the **suits** of the resolved cards).

Additionally, as long as there is a **joker** in your **discard pile**, all damage dealt by your **Blinding Flush**, **Double Trouble**, and **Magic Flush** effects ignores Immunities and Resistances.
