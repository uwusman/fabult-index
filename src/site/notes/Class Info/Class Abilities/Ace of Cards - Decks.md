## MANAGING THE DECK 
1. Your **deck** is an actual deck of cards that you can assemble however you prefer, provided their backs are identical and you follow the restrictions below: 
	- The deck contains exactly **30 cards**: **2 jokers**, plus **28 cards** divided into **4 types**, called **suits**; for instance, in a standard poker deck the **suits** are **clubs** (♣), **diamonds** (♦), **hearts** (♥), and **spades** (♠). When you create your character's deck, associate each suit to a different damage type among *air*, *earth*, *fire*, and *ice*. 
		- For each **suit**, the deck contains **7 cards** with **values 1 to 7**. 

The simplest approach is to use a poker deck (removing **face cards** and **cards numbered 8 to 10**), but you can also use minor arcana from tarot, cards from collectible card games, and much more; just make sure the combinations are easy to identify.
1. When a **conflict** begins, shuffle all 30 cards in your **deck** and place it **face down** in front of yourself, then draw **5 cards** to form your starting **hand**. 
2. If you need to draw cards and your **deck** doesn't have enough, draw as many as you can, **shuffle your discard pile into the deck**, place it **face down**, then keep drawing.
3. When you draw cards from your **deck**, they are put into your **hand**. Normally only you can see your **hand**, but you can show it to others if you so wish. 
4. When you discard cards from your **hand**, place them **face up** into your **discard pile**, in whatever order you prefer. However, the order of cards in your **discard pile** cannot be modified. 
Your **deck**, your **hand**, and your **discard pile** (as well as any [[Skills\|Skills]] and effects related to them) are only available during conflict [[scenes\|scenes]]; at the end of each conflict, shuffle all 30 cards back into your **deck** and put it aside.

## Resolving a Set
To produce a given effect, a **set** must match its requirements **exactly** (for instance, resolving a **set of 5 cards with the same value** will not match the requirements of **Jackpot**; it has to be composed of **exactly 4 cards**).

When you resolve a **set** that includes **jokers**, you choose their **suit** and **value** (**1** to **7**).

If a **set** matches the requirements of two or more effects, you must choose and apply **only one** of those effects.

> [!TIP] Tip:
> If you use a classic poker deck, the recommended suit types are: air (♦), earth (♣), fire (♥), and ice (♠)


| Effect Name    | Set Requirements                                      | Effects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Jackpot        | 4 cards of the same value, none of which is a joker   | You and every ally present on the scene recover 777 Hit Points and 777 Mind Points; any PCs who have **surrendered** but are still part of the scene immediately regain consciousness (this does not cancel the effects of their **Surrender**).                                      |
| Magic Flush    | 4 cards of consecutive values and of the same suit    | You deal damage equal to **【25 + the total value of the resolved cards】** to each enemy present on the scene; the type of this damage matches the **suit** of the resolved cards.                                                                                                     |
| Blinding Flush | 4 cards of consecutive values                         | You deal damage equal to **【15 + the total value of the resolved cards】** to each enemy present on the scene; the type of this damage is **light** if the highest value among those cards is **even**, or **dark** if that value is **odd**.                                          |
| Full Status    | 3 cards of the same value + 2 cards of the same value | Choose two status effects among **dazed**, **shaken**, **slow**, and **weak**: if **【the highest value among resolved cards】** is **even**, you and every ally present on the scene recover from the chosen status effects; if **odd**, each enemy present on the scene suffers them. |
| Triple Support | 3 cards of the same value                             | You and every ally present on the scene regain an amount of Hit Points and Mind Points equal to **【the total value of the resolved cards, multiplied by 3】**.                                                                                                                         |
| Double Trouble | 2 cards of the same value + 2 cards of the same value | You deal damage equal to **【10 + the highest value among resolved cards】** to each of **up to two** different enemies you can see that are present on the scene; the type of this damage is one of your choice among those matching the **suits** of the resolved cards.              |
| Magic Pair     | 2 cards of the same value                             | You perform a **free attack** with a weapon you have equipped. If this attack deals damage, choose a **suit** among those of the resolved cards; all damage dealt by the attack becomes of the type matching that **suit**.                                                           |

> [!INFO] Note
